The DataTank core is the framework in which the main application of The DataTank is built. The DataTank is a web application that publishes data to URIs in web readable formats. This means that you provide a nice JSON, XML, PHP, ... serialization on a certain URI of data that resides somewhere in a CSV, XLS, XML, JSON, SHP, ... file or any other machine readable data container. In short, it provides an instant REST API on top of any machine readable data.
