<p>RAP - RDF API for PHP is a Semantic Web toolkit for PHP developers. RAP started 
  as an open source project at the Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin in 2002 and has 
  been extended with internal and external code contributions since then. Its 
  latest release includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a statement-centric API for manipulating RDF graphs as a set of statements</li>
  <li>a resource-centric API for manipulating RDF graphs as a set of resources 
  </li>
  <li>integrated RDF/XML, N3 and N-TRIPLE parsers</li>
  <li>integrated RDF/XML, N3 and N-TRIPLE serializers </li>
  <li>in-memory or database model storage </li>
  <li>support for the RDQL query language</li>
  <li>an inference engine supporting RDF-Schema reasoning and some OWL entailments 
  </li>
  <li>an RDF server providing similar functionality as the <a href="http://www.joseki.org/" target="_blank">Joseki 
    RDF server</a></li>
  <li><a href="db_utils.htm">a graphical user-interface</a>  for managing database-backed RDF models </li>
  <li>support for common vocabularies</li>

<p>RAP offers two different programming interfaces for manipulating RDF graphs: 
  The statement-centric <strong>Model API</strong> which allows you to manipulate 
  an RDF graph as a set of statements; and the resource-centric <strong>ResModel 
  API</strong> for manipulating an RDF graph as a set of resources. </p>
<p>The Model API supports adding, deleting, and replacing statements inside a 
  model as well as adding entire models. StatementIterators allow sequential access 
  to all statements within a model. There are four different implementations of 
  the Model API:</p>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>The resource-centric ResModel API represents RDF graphs as resources having 
  properties. The ResModel API is very similar to the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Jena 
  Model API</a> allowing programmers, which are used to Jena, to easily write 
  RAP code. The ResModel API is implemented on top of the Model API. ResModels 
  are always having a underlying MemModel, DbModel, InfModelF or InfModelB and 
  are only providing a resource-centric view on this model. There are two implementations 
  of the ResModel API:</p>

    <tr bgcolor="#cccccc"> 
      <th width="106"> <p>Model</p></th>

<p>The following sections are explaining the different RAP models in more detail. 
  Further tutorial and RAP usage examples are found on the RAP <a href="../tests.html">Documentation</a> overview page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="memmodel" id="memmodel"></a>The MemModel </h2>
<p>The MemModel implementation stores statements in an array in the system memory. 
  If a new statement is added to the model, it's appended to the array and added 
  to a statement index in order to accelerate queries. MemModel is the fastest 
  of all Model API implementations.</p>
<p><img src="img/memmodel.png" /><br />
</p>
<p> Further information about using the MemModel can be found in the &quot;<span class="sectionHeading"><a href="usingthemodelapi.htm">Using 
  RAP's Statement-Centric MemModel API</a></span>&quot; tutorial and in the <a href="../phpdoc/index_memmodel.html">MemModel 
  PHPDoc</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a name="dbmodel" id="dbmodel"></a>The DbModel </h2>
<p>The DbModel implementation stores statements in an relational database. DbModel 
  supports a wide range of different databases by using the ADODB database abstraction 
  layer. The core of RAP's database backend are the classes DbStore and DbModel. 
  The former represents all models stored in a database, whereas the latter provides 
  methods for manipulating these models.<br />
  <br />
  <img src="img/dbmodel.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>RAP uses a denormalized database schema, where all statements are written into 
  a single statement table. We compared the performance of this solution with 
  a normalized layout. Running benchmarks has shown that the denormalized schema 
  was 2-3 times faster than the normalized one. The trade-off between better performance 
  and increased database size was acceptable for medium-sized RDF models. </p>
<p>Further information about using the DbModel can be found in the tutorial about 
  &quot;<a href="database_persistence.htm">Database Persistence</a>&quot; and 
  in the <a href="../phpdoc/index_dbmodel.html">DbModel PHPDoc</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
  <h2><a name="infmodel" id="infmodel"></a>The InfModels</h2>
<p> InfModel extends MemModel by adding the ability to infer additional statements. 
  Up to our knowledge, InfModel is the only reasoning engine implemented in PHP. 
  The performance of InfModel can't compete with the performance of reasoning 
  engines implemented in Java or C, because PHP still isn't a very fast language. 
  But for medium sized models and relatively small RDF-S schemata, InfModel works 
  fine. InfModel supports the following RDF-S and OWL constructs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>rdfs:subclass</li>
    <li>rdfs:subproperty</li>
    <li>rdfs:range</li>
    <li>rdfs:domain</li>
    <li>owl:sameAs</li>
    <li>owl:inverseOf</li>
  </ul>
<p>Additionally, the following inference rules from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/tr/2004/rec-rdf-mt-20040210/" target="_blank">W3C 
  RDF Semantics Recommendation</a> are supported:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RDFS Rule 6 </li>
    <li>RDFS Rule 8</li>
    <li>RDFS Rule 10</li>
    <li>RDFS Rule 12</li>
    <li>RDFS Rule 13 </li>
  </ul>
<p>You can activate and deactivate the different rules separately in constants.php. 
  Turning off rules that you don't need improves the performance of InfModel.</p>
<p>The abstract class InfModel is extended by two subclasses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>InfModelF, which uses a forward chaining inference algorithm.</li>
  <li>InfModelB, which uses a backward chaining inference algorithm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pros and cons of both algorithms are described below:</p>
<h3><br />
    <a name="infmodelf" id="infmodelf"></a>The InfModelF</h3>
<p>InfModelF uses a forward chaining inference algorithm: If a new statement from 
  the RDFS or OWL namespace is added to the model, a corresponding InfRule is 
  added to the model's rule-base. The rule has a trigger and an entailment. If 
  a new statement, which matches the trigger of an InfRule, is added to the model 
  then the entailment will be recursively computed until no more rule-triggers 
  match the statement or statements inferred from it. The base statement and all 
  inferred statements are added to the model.<br />
</p>
<p><img src="img/infmodelf.png" width="328" height="428" /><br />
</p>
<p>Materializing all possible inferred statements means that adding base statements 
  to the model is relatively slow. On the other hand find operations are very 
  fast, because the find method just has to look into the statement index and 
  return the matching statements (including inferred statements). </p>
<p>Thus you should use InfModelF </p>
<ul>
  <li>if your model doesn't change much and </li>
  <li>you are going to query the model a lot.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Further information about using the InfModelF can be found in  the <a href="../phpdoc/index_infmodelF.html">InfModelF PHPDoc</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="infmodelb" id="infmodelb"></a>The InfModelB</h3>
<p>InfModelB uses a backward chaining inference algorithm, meaning that no inferences 
  are done when a new statement is added to the model. When a query is executed 
  against the model later, only the necessary inferences for this query are done: 
  A find-patter is executed with the supplied parameters first. Afterwards it 
  is checked against an inference-rules index, if there are any rules that could 
  produce statements that would match the find-pattern. If there are such rules, 
  the find-pattern is rewritten an a new search is done. The new statements are 
  inferred and added to the result. This iterative process will be repeated until 
  there are no rules left that could produce matching statements. </p>
<p><img src="img/infmodelb.png" width="324" height="381" /><br />
</p>
<p>InfModelB recognizes subclassing loops in ontologies. It also uses some shortcuts 
  which speed up the search process: It recognizes branches in the ontology that 
  don't lead to any additional statements and avoids running into these 'dead 
  ends' a second time. </p>
<p>You should use InfModelB:</p>
<ul>
  <li> if your model changes a lot, </li>
  <li> if you don't want to materialize all inferred statements, </li>
  <li> if you are having a lot of RDF-S statements or </li>
  <li>if you are not going to execute too many queries against the model.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Further information about using the InfModelB can be found in the <a href="../phpdoc/index_infmodelB.html">InfModelB PHPDoc</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
  <h2><a name="resmodel" id="resmodel"></a>The ResModel </h2>
<p>ResModel provides a resource-centric view on an underlying Model. ResModels 
  represent an RDF graphs as a set of resources having properties, similar to 
  the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Jena Model API</a>. 
  The ResModel API is implemented on top of the Model API. Thus ResModels are 
  always having a underlying MemModel, DbModel, InfModelF or InfModelB and are 
  only providing a resource-centric view on this model.</p>
<p> <img src="img/resmodel.png" width="324" height="343" /></p>
<p>Each ResModel method call is translated into a find()-, add()-, or remove()-call 
  to the underlying model. Thus using ResModel is slightly slower than using the 
  underlying model directly. The ResModel API also provides support for special 
  resources like rdf:containers and rdf:collections. There is no caching done 
  between the layers.</p>
<p>Further information about using the ResModel can be found in the tutorial about 
  &quot;<a href="usingtheresmodelapi.htm">Using RAP's Resource-Centric ResModel 
  API&quot;</a> and in the<a href="../phpdoc/index_resmodel.html"> ResModel PHPDoc</a>.<br />
</p>
<h2><a name="ontmodel" id="ontmodel"></a>The OntModel</h2>
<p>OntModel API provides a ResModel implementation extended with RDF-Schema specific 
  methods like addSubClass(), listSubClasses(), hasSuperProperty(), addDomain() 
  and listInstances(). </p>
<p>OntModel just provides a more convenient API for working with RDF-S models, 
  but doesn't do any inference by itself. If you also need RDF-S inference 
  you have to combine OntModel with an underlying InfModelF or InfModelB. If you 
  don't need inference you can combine OntModel with an underlying MemModel 
  or DbModel. </p>
<p><img src="img/ontmodel.png" width="324" height="343" /></p>
<p>Further information about OntModel can be found in the tutorial about &quot;<span class="sectionHeading"><a href="usingtheontmodelapi.htm">Using 
  RAP's Ontology-Centric OntModel API</a></span>&quot; and in the <a href="../phpdoc/index_ontmodel.html">OntModel PHPDoc</a>.</p>
